This project implements an image uploader, that uploads the images to [Tencent COS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos) instead of storing them locally in your vault.

## Installation

Install the plugin via the [Community Plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Third-party+plugins#Discover+and+install+community+plugins) tab within Obsidian
